    "**Purpose** - reduces overfitting, improves accuracy (sometimes), reduces training time.\n",
    "## Feature Selection \n",
    "**In a nutshell**: runs analysis on dataset and returns the best set of features which can be used for classification. <br>\n",
    "* **Filter Method** - calculate correlation of feature variable with target variable. The features are ranked by the score and either selected to be kept or removed from the dataset. (eg. Chi-square, information gain, correlation coefficient scores)<br>\n",
    "* **Wrapper Method** - search for combination of variables that performs the best using a certain heuristic (e.g. subset, forward, backward elimination) <br>\n",
    "* **Embedded method** - learn which features best contribute to accuracy while model is being created using regularization methods (e.g. Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net)<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature Extraction \n",
    "**In a nutshell**: use initial features to build derived features that are more informative and non-redundent than the original dataset. This is different from feature selection in that feature extraction combines all feature information into newly-created features without completely eliminating low-contributing features (e.g. PCA, NMF, kernel PCA, Graph-based kernel PCA etc.). <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## What we are using:\n",
    "* **Lasso** - a **feature selection** method that uses cross-validation LASSO regression to filter out un-important features <br>\n",
    "* **PCA** - a **feature extraction** method uses the correlation between some dimensions and tries to provide a minimum number of variables that keeps the maximum amount of variation or information about how the original data is distributed. <br>\n",
    "* **t-SNE** - a **dimensionality reduction** method that maps multi-dimensional data to a lower dimensional space (typcially 2 or 3), by constructing pairwise probability distribution, modeling similar objects then minimizing KL divergence between original data and lower-dimensional data. This is mainly used for visualizing high-dimensional data, not for feeding directly into models. <br>"
